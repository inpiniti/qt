# Cache Components

*Note: This might refer to the experimental "use cache" directive or general caching strategies in newer Next.js versions. See API Reference > Directives for "use cache".*

Next.js provides caching mechanisms for components and data to optimize performance.

- **Request Memoization**: Reuse data fetch requests in a single render pass.
- **Data Cache**: Store data fetch results across requests.
- **Full Route Cache**: Store the HTML and RSC payload of routes.
- **Router Cache**: Client-side cache for navigation.
