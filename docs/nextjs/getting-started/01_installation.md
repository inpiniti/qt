# Installation

Get started with Next.js by creating a new app.

## Automatic Installation

We recommend using `create-next-app` to start a new Next.js app, which sets up everything automatically for you.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

## Manual Installation

To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```
