# Next.js 14+ Overview & Setup

## What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.
It automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers, allowing you to focus on building your product.

## App Router vs Pages Router
Next.js has two different routers:
- **App Router**: The newer router that supports new React features like Server Components. (Recommended for new projects)
- **Pages Router**: The original router.

## Getting Started
To create a new Next.js app:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```
