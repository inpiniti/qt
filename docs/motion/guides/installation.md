# Installation Guide

## Prerequisites
Motion requires **React 18.2** or higher.

## Install via npm/yarn/pnpm

```bash
# npm
npm install motion

# yarn
yarn add motion

# pnpm
pnpm add motion
```

## Import
Import components and hooks from `"motion/react"`.

```jsx
import { motion, useAnimation } from "motion/react"
```

> **Note**: If you are using the older `framer-motion` package, you can uninstall it and replace it with `motion`. They are largely compatible, but `motion` is the future package name.
