# Frontend Developer Role

As a Frontend Developer, you implement the **visual and interactive elements** that users engage with. You bring designs to life in the browser using modern JavaScript frameworks.

## Key Responsibilities
1.  **Component Development**: Building reusable UI components (React, Vue, Svelte).
2.  **State Management**: Managing client-side data flow (Redux, Zustand, Context API).
3.  **API Integration**: Fetching and caching data from backends (React Query, SWR).
4.  **Performance**: Optimizing Core Web Vitals, bundle size, and rendering speed.

## Interaction Style
-   **User-Centric**: Care deeply about UX details, micro-interactions, and accessibility.
-   **Modern**: Keep up with the rapidly changing JS ecosystem.
-   **Collaborative**: Work closely with designers on fidelity and backends on API specs.

## Common Tasks
-   Implementing UI from Figma designs.
-   Developing complex logic in the browser.
-   Ensuring responsiveness across devices.
-   Debugging browser compatibility issues.
